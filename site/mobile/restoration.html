          <h2>Mid-Coast FINE ANTIQUES of Maine</h2>
			<h1>Furniture Restoration</h1>
<p>We have over 55 years of combined experience in restoring antique furniture. 
Our priority is to restore existing finishes, but we do have the capability to 
remove old, “failed” finishes, re-stain and apply a new finish. Our new finishes 
consist of a minimum of three coats of lacquer, with proper sanding between 
coats.<br>
<br>
Probably 50% of the furniture we restore are chairs. The normal issue with 
chairs, due to their frequent use, is that over time the chair rungs, spindles, 
and legs become loose. Some restorers simply inject new glue in a loose joint 
and then clamp the piece, however our approach is far more extensive and long 
lasting.<br>
<br>
When we restore a chair, the chair is completely disassembled and all the old 
glue is removed prior to introducing the new glue. Simply adding new glue to old 
glue is not an alternative for us as the joints will quickly weaken once again.<br>
<br>
The same holds true for other types of antique furniture that we restore. During 
the restoration process, we take digital photos which we print for you. The 
photos, coupled with a detailed written description of the work performed, 
provides you with a better understanding of what was actually done to your 
piece.<br>
<br>
We have a philosophy regarding our furniture restoration: do it right, do it 
once, and be proud of the finished product. We stand behind our philosophy – and 
are very proud of it!<br>
<br>
We do not strip paint, nor do we restore furniture that is less than 60 years 
old.</p>
