          <p>Mid-Coast FINE ANTIQUES of Maine is a family business, owned by Francine and   Benjie Grant. Francine got her start in the antique business as a recorder for   an auctioneer in 1960, and readily acquired an interest in antiques. By 1962 she   was buying and selling antiques - and has never looked back. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            <img src="photos/francine.jpg" alt="Francine at Work! " width="234" height="249" align="right" />She and Benjie were married in 1977, with Benjie acquiring the love of   antiques from Francine rather quickly while still working full time in the   family’s dairy business. With Francine&#39;s assistance, Benjie has collected   numerous dairy related antiques including a selection of horse drawn dairy   advertising wagons. A portion of his collection is on display at the shop for   all to enjoy.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Shortly after the marriage, Francine and Benjie purchased a home in  Holden, a cape built in 1802. We totally restored our  home, exposing the charm of the house to its original period. The house has the  distinction of being the oldest standing house in Holden. At this juncture the  name of Francine's antique business was &quot;1802 House Antiques&quot;.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            As Francine&#39;s business grew we found ourselves in need of additional   space. This led us, in 1984, to the purchase the former Pinkham&#39;s General Store   building, also located in Holden. Pinkham&#39;s General Store was built in 1884 and   truly had wonderful Maine country charm. It, by the way, is the oldest   commercial standing building in the town of Holden. This building had been severely neglected since it closed as a general   store in the early &#39;50&#39;s, but with a lot of TLC we restored this building back   to its original state, starting with the basement, followed by the 1st and 2nd   floors. Upon completion of the rehab we opened Francine&#39;s greatly expanded shop   in 1985, with a new shop name, &quot;Country Store Antiques&quot;.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            By 1998 we both realized that if we were going to stay in the business for   another 20 years, we needed to make one final leap, that being to an even larger   shop, and more specifically, a shop on one level. We commenced building a new   facility in the summer of 2000 with the majority of the completion being   finished by December of 2000.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            Neither previous shop names were appropriate for our new, greatly expanded   facility, so consequently we opted for a new name,  &quot;Mid-Coast FINE ANTIQUES of   Maine&quot;. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
            We were lucky to have had the opportunity to make the &quot;final move&quot; and we   are both extremely pleased and excited with our new location, it being 1.5 miles   to the east (towards Bangor) from the former Country Store Antiques location,   and yes, we are still in Holden.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
