		SINGLE ITEMS TO COMPLETE ESTATES</h3>
        <p>Francine is always buying quality antique furniture and antique  accessories (china, cut glass, porcelain, lighting, etc.), collectables, dolls,  jewelry (estate and costume), marine items, paintings, and weathervanes. Simply  stated, if you see a piece(s) in one of our photos that is similar to or the  same as what you are seeking to sell, them Francine would be interested in it. </p>
        <p align="left">          <img src="galleries/shop/images/PieSafe-08-150.jpg" width="284" height="650" border="1" align="right" />Many ask: how do I go about selling to Francine? Initially you  should call Francine, 207-843-7449, and seek to describe what it is  that you have to sell. If it is a day when the shop is not open, simply leave a  message on the answer phone indicating that you have items to sell along with  your name, telephone number and the best time for Francine to call you back.</p>
        <p>          Another way to sell to Francine is to bring the piece(s) to the  shop for Francine to look at. If this is not feasible for you due to the number  of pieces that you have to sell or the distance you are from the shop, then we  suggest that you send Francine digital photos of the piece(s) that you are  interested in selling via email to <a href="mailto:benjie@mid-coast-antiques.com">benjie@mid-coast-antiques.com</a> and provide  a brief description of the piece(s) condition.</p>
        <p>          Some ask: will Francine come to my home to look at the piece(s)  you have to sell? The answer is yes, with a “qualifier.” The “qualifier” is  what do you have to sell, and how far are you, distance wise, from Holden? With  today’s cost of gasoline, to drive 30 or so miles one way to look at a few  pieces normally is not cost effective without Francine first seeking to qualify  with you, or with the aid of digital photos, what it is you are seeking to  sell. </p>
        <p>          Whether you bring the piece(s)to the shop or provide digital  photos for Francine, if Francine is not interested in buying some or any of  your items, she will be happy to provide you with the name(s) of other  antique dealers or auctioneers that would possibly be interested in the  piece(s) you are seeking to sell.</p>
        <p>          The one phase we hear frequently is: “I am responsible for  selling my parent’s, or grandparent’s home and need to sell its contents. I have  already hauled 3 loads of “junk” to the dump that was in the attic, basement,  barn, etc.”  We would advise you not to  haul what you feel is “junk” to the dump until Francine, or for that matter,  any other dealer that you  contact, has looked through what you feel is  “junk”. Sometimes there are pieces in the “junk” that have value. Remember the  old saying: “one man’s trash, may be another man’s treasure.” Other times, it  may truly be “junk”, but by having someone look first, you may be pleasantly  surprised. </p>
